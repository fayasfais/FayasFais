Hi there 👋 My name is Fayas Fais, and I’m a tech-driven project manager in training, passionate about systems, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
Strengthening my portfolio with real-world software projects and sharpening my project management skill set.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Advanced networking concepts, software engineering fundamentals, and practical tools used in project coordination + team leadership.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Web applications, system development projects, and anything that blends tech with smart team workflows.

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
Finding internship opportunities in Project Management, Project Coordination, and Tech Team Leadership roles.

💬 Ask me about:
Networking, system design basics, team coordination, academic project execution, or how to survive an HND while still levelling up.

📫 How to reach me:

⚡ Fun fact:
I graduated my HND at 19, built working systems before touching any top-up degree, and still pull off aesthetic vibes while debugging at 2AM.
